# Rebirth Framework

<img src="./src/code/assets/rebirth.png" style="right:0" align="right" width="250px">

## A Typescript Framework that runs on the Javascript & NodeJS runtime

This framework was built in hopes of becoming `superior` to other frameworks like ESX or QBCore. While most frameworks use Lua as the main language we have decided to build the entire framework using Typescript

#### This framework should only be `Used` and `Edited` by those who understand programming in typescript and are Skilled in a few of the following: 

1. Command Line Usage
2. Javascript/Typescript
3. Understanding module bunders such as `Webpack` `ESBuild`
4. Node.JS Package Managers such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) | [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/)
5. Experience in Database Programs such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
